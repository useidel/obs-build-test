# obs-test-builds

Test with Github Webhooks and OBS .. using this instructions: https://openbuildservice.org/help/manuals/obs-user-guide/cha.obs.scm_ci_workflow_integration.html

Please note this repo only covers the connection between Github and OBS. A major missing part is pushing the (changed) content from the Github repo to the OBS package. 

If you step away from the [Github Webhooks framework](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/webhooks-and-events/webhooks/about-webhooks) and use [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) instead, things might be easier. If this caught your interest you may want to checkout my other Repo [obs-build-test2](https://github.com/useidel/obs-build-test2).
